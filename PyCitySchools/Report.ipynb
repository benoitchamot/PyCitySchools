    "\n",
    "First, we cover the analysis of the import and analysis of the provided data. The analysis is done in the same order as the assignment, with one part per main requirements:\n",
    "- Part 1: Local Government Area (LGA) Summary\n",
    "- Part 2: School Summary\n",
    "- Part 3: Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\n",
    "- Part 4: Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\n",
    "- Part 5: Maths Scores by Year\n",
    "- Part 6: Reading Scores by Year\n",
    "- Part 7: Scores by School Spending\n",
    "- Part 8: Scores by School Size\n",
    "- Part 9: Scores by School Type\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second and last section, we provide our conclusions based on the data we extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure hopefully allows to clearly separate the coding and extraction of the main metrics from the conclusion we draw from them. For clarity, each section about Part 1-9 includes a subsection called \"Solution to Part\" that provides all the required data from the assignment instructions. "
